This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

A webapp to curate a collaborative to-do list for a home. Add tasks, subtasks, 
update statuses, take pictures of completed work, leave comments, get updates in real time.

To start: yarn start

To test: yarn test


Todo board:
-
1. Pull tasks from server
2. Set cookie on authentication so that a user doesn't have to reauth on refresh
2a. Stop checking for userPrincipal - instead do a quick call to the server to get user information.
